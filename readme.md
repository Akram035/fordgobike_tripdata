# (Bay Wheels's trip data exploration)

## Dataset

> The dataset is Bay Wheels's trip data From Lyft. it provides information about the bikes rentals in a certain month(I chose the dataset from July 2017) providing columns for rental duration ,start date and time, end station and bikes IDs.


## Summary of Findings

> 1-	The durations for most rides are between 2 and 100 minutes with some outliers.
2-	Weekdays have more rides than weekends
3-	Weekends have rides with longer durations than the weekdays
4-	October has the greatest number of rides while June has the lowest
5-	Subscribers have far more rides than Customers, but Customers have longer durations
6-	'San Francisco Ferry Building (Harry Bridges Plaza)' is the most used starting station



## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation I mainly focused on the key discoveries from the exploratory data analysis such as the distribution of ride duration and how to be visualized informatively and how the ride duration and the rides number are affected by the day, the month and the user type
